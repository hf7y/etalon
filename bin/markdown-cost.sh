# MEASURE_UNIT is the version of the QUESTION, not of the script. Bump it only
# when a change makes an old baseline mean something different -- a new language
# priced, a predicate widened. A bug fix that makes the same question answered
# correctly does NOT bump it.
#
#   1  markdown + '#' and '//' comment lines
#   2  ...and Python docstrings (2026-08-26)
#   3  ...and files behind a scaffolding suffix (hf7y/etalon#18)
#   4  PROSE-BEARING FILES, not prose lines
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Unit 2 raised five of six estate repos above their
# committed floor at once (crt +3278, wtul +1933, senechal +693). The ratchet
# only falls and --accept refuses to raise, so without this the whole estate
# wedges: no PR passes anywhere, and the only way out is the hand edit the
# guard is built to reject. A measurement change is not prose growth, and must
# not be charged as it.
#
# It is NOT an override, and it is deliberately not reachable from a repo. On a
# unit mismatch the committed integer is never read as a floor -- it is in the
# wrong unit and says nothing -- so the floor becomes the merge-base tree,
# measured LIVE in the current unit. Editing the stamp in your own ratchet
# therefore buys nothing: the branch still cannot add a line, because the
# comparison it must pass never involved the stamped number.
# Unit 4 is not a widened predicate -- it is a different question, and the
# reason is an invariant about what a unit can be paid in. A LINE count is
# payable by rewriting your own lines, so the cheapest way to clear it is to
# truncate a comment in a file that stays; the branch pays and the tree does
# not, which is how a comment comes to end mid-sentence. A FILE count admits
# only one payment: a file stops existing. Shaving is then worth exactly
# nothing, and the guard can no longer ask for a move that damages the tree.
# The evidence this was reversed on is in hf7y/realisateur#1142.
